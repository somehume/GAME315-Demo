# GAME315 Demo Readme

### Notice:

Sometime after spring 2025 grades are submitted, this repository will be restructured. You will not lose access to the repository, but it will hopefully be more organized. The current structure is somewhat chaotic, as I was focused on getting content out to you. Hopefully, the new structure will be more intuitive, especially for new students and those of you who want to revisit the material later.

The current idea is to have a folder for each week, as I started to in week 12. One difference is that the week folders will be at the root level of the repository, rather than within each of the asset folders. This will make it easier to find the week you are looking for. The week folders will contain a readme file with a description of the content for that week.

### Week 10

**Statics**
In lieu of a presentation, we are going to reverse engineer a mini-game as we discuss the use of statics using scene W10Main.
